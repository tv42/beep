# Beep -- make a simple completion noise from command line

The command `beep` makes a simple, recognizable, noise from a command
line, shell script, or such. Typical use:

```
mv bigfile /media/slow/; beep
```

The command is named "beep" because I've had something by this name in
use since the days of PC speakers.
